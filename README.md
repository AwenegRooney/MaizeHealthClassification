# ðŸŒ½ Maize Crop Health Detection (Satellite-based)
### ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project aims to build an early pest and disease detection system for maize farms using satellite imagery (Sentinel-2 via Google Earth Engine).
The system extracts spectral bands and vegetation indices (NDVI, EVI, etc.) to train a Random Forest (RF) model that classifies fields as healthy or infected.
